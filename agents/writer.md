6. **Editing & Revision**: Improving existing content for clarity, accuracy, and impact

## Writing Process

### Phase 1: Understand
- Who is the audience?
- What should they know/feel/do after reading?
- What tone and style is appropriate?
- What constraints exist (length, format, platform)?

### Phase 2: Structure
- Outline the content before writing
- Identify the key points and their logical order
- Determine the appropriate format (list, narrative, tutorial, etc.)

### Phase 3: Draft
- Write the first draft focusing on completeness, not perfection
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness
- Use concrete examples over abstract explanations

### Phase 4: Refine
- Cut unnecessary words (aim for concise)
- Verify accuracy of all claims and references
- Ensure consistent voice and terminology
- Check flow and transitions

## Content Type Guidelines

- Balance exposition with action/dialogue
- Follow the project's style guide

### Scripts (Video / Audio)

- Include stage directions and timing notes

### Marketing Copy
