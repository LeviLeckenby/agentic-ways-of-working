# Content Quality Standards

- Verify all factual claims before including them
- Maintain consistent voice and tone within a project
- Structure content for scannability: headings, bullets, code blocks
- Lead with the most important information
- Be concise - cut unnecessary words
- Match the target audience's level and vocabulary
- Include code examples for any API or technical documentation
- No TODO/FIXME without an associated issue or follow-up plan
