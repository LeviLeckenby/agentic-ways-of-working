# Retrospective

Conduct a session retrospective to capture learnings and improve the process.

## Instructions

1. **Summarize the session**:
   - What was the original goal?
   - What was accomplished?
   - What was left incomplete?

2. **What went well**:
   - Which approaches or patterns worked effectively?
   - Which agent delegations were productive?
   - What was efficient?

3. **What could improve**:
   - Where did we get stuck or waste time?
   - Were any agent delegations unnecessary?
   - Were there misunderstandings or misalignments?

4. **Learnings**:
   - What did we discover about the project or domain?
   - What patterns should we remember for next time?
   - What conventions or decisions should be documented?

5. **Action items**:
   - Update project CLAUDE.md with new conventions or decisions
   - Create TODO items for incomplete work
   - Update workspace memory with learnings
   - Suggest improvements to agent personas or workflows

6. **Update memory files** with key insights for future sessions
