# Skill: Research

Methodology for conducting effective research tasks.

---

## Research Types

### Technology Evaluation
Comparing tools, libraries, or frameworks for adoption.

**Process:**
1. Define evaluation criteria (must-haves, nice-to-haves)
2. Identify candidates (usually 3-5)
3. Research each candidate: docs, community, maintenance, compatibility
4. Create comparison matrix
5. Make a recommendation with rationale

### Domain Exploration
Understanding an unfamiliar problem space or business domain.

**Process:**
1. Start with broad survey (what are the key concepts?)
2. Identify authoritative sources
3. Map the terminology and relationships
4. Identify constraints and edge cases
5. Summarize in domain-appropriate language

### Best Practices Survey
Finding the state-of-the-art for a specific practice.

**Process:**
1. Search for authoritative guides and documentation
2. Look for community consensus and patterns
3. Check for recent changes or evolution in practices
4. Note disagreements or alternative schools of thought
5. Recommend based on project context

### Competitive / Landscape Analysis
Understanding the competitive environment.

**Process:**
1. Identify direct and indirect competitors
2. Analyze their approaches, strengths, and weaknesses
3. Identify gaps and opportunities
4. Summarize positioning implications

## Research Quality Standards

- **Multiple sources** - Never rely on a single source
- **Recency** - Flag information more than 2 years old
- **Credibility** - Prefer official docs, established experts, peer-reviewed work
- **Completeness** - Look for what's missing, not just what's said
- **Actionability** - Every finding should connect to a decision or action

## Output Template

```
## Research: {Topic}
### Question: {What we need to answer}
### Key Findings: {Numbered list with evidence}
### Analysis: {Synthesis and comparison}
### Recommendation: {What to do}
### Confidence: {High/Medium/Low with reasoning}
### Gaps: {What we still don't know}
```
