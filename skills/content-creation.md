## Content Creation Process

### 1. Brief
- Define the audience, purpose, and format
- Set the tone and style
- Identify key messages and takeaways
- Determine length and structure constraints

### 2. Research
- Gather source material and references
- Verify facts and claims
- Identify unique angles or insights
- Review competing/existing content in the space

### 3. Outline
- Create a structured outline before drafting
- Ensure logical flow from intro to conclusion
- Identify where examples, evidence, or visuals are needed
- Get outline approved before proceeding

### 4. Draft
- Write the first draft focusing on completeness
- Don't self-edit heavily during drafting
- Follow the outline but allow organic evolution
- Mark uncertain sections with [TBD] for review

### 5. Edit
- First pass: Structure and flow (macro editing)
- Second pass: Clarity and conciseness (line editing)
- Third pass: Accuracy and consistency (fact-checking)
- Fourth pass: Grammar and polish (copy editing)

### 6. Review
- External review against the original brief
- Audience-appropriateness check
- Brand/voice consistency check
- Final approval before publication

## Format-Specific Guidelines

### Books / Long-Form Writing
- Maintain a master outline and style guide
- Write chapter-by-chapter with regular continuity checks
- Track character/concept consistency (for creative work)
- Use beta readers or review passes between major sections

### Video Scripts
- Write for speech (short sentences, natural rhythm)
- Include visual direction and timing
- Write B-roll/visual suggestions alongside narration
- Include intro hook, clear structure, and call-to-action

### Audio / Podcast
- Conversational tone, written for the ear
- Include segment markers and timing estimates
- Write transitions between topics
- Include show notes and key timestamps

### Marketing Content
- Lead with the benefit
- Use social proof and specificity
- Clear call-to-action in every piece
- A/B test headlines and CTAs when possible
